Description
Evaluation

An entry to the competition consists of a Notebook submission. Bonus multipliers are awarded for the optional Blogpost submission (up to 1.5x) and YouTube video submission (up to 1.5x).
Requirements

The notebooks must have the following minimum requirements, otherwise will be given a score of 0:

    compilability of the notebook: the notebook must work without errors when executed end-to-end
    minimum three (3) gen AI capabilities used in the notebook: see list of capabilities in Gen AI Capabilities
    the Kaggle notebook (and blogpost & video, if available) must be publicly viewable

Maximum Score

The maximum score for a submission is 22.5:

    Notebook: 10 pts max
    Blogpost: Bonus multiplier up to 1.5x
    Video: Bonus multiplier up to 1.5x
    Maximum total = 10 (Notebook) * 1.5 (Blogpost) * 1.5 (Video)

Notebook scoring (out of 10 points):

Use Case and Innovation (up to 5 points for the Notebook):

    how creative, novel, innovative, or impactful is the use case?
    how well-suited is the usage of the gen AI capabilities to the use case shown?

Documentation quality (up to 5 points for the Notebook):

    how clear is the notebook documented? (if it's only code cells, the score would be 0)
    does the notebook start with a clear use case or problem, and how gen AI can solve the problem?
    does the notebook show and explain how the problem is solved in code with gen AI?

Blogpost (Bonus multiplier up to 1.5x):

    does the blogpost communicate a clear use case or problem, and how gen AI can solve the problem?
    does the blogpost show some snippets of code to demonstrate how it was implemented?
    does the blogpost talk about limitations of the technology or approach, and/or future art-of-the-possible?

YouTube video (Bonus multiplier up to 1.5x):

    does the YouTube video have a combination of visuals and a voiceover?
    does the YouTube video have a good combination of technical explanation and storytelling?

Judging

Judges will consist of gen AI experts across engineering and marketing at Google.
Gen AI Capabilities

In your Capstone Project, you must demonstrate at least three (3) of the gen AI capabilities from the list below:

    Structured output/JSON mode/controlled generation
    Few-shot prompting
    Document understanding
    Image understanding
    Video understanding
    Audio understanding
    Function Calling
    Agents
    Long context window
    Context caching
    Gen AI evaluation
    Grounding
    Embeddings
    Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)
    Vector search/vector store/vector database
    MLOps (with GenAI)

Teams

    You can submit as an individual or a team.
    Only one submission per participant will count, whether you submit as an individual or as part of a team. If your team makes multiple submissions, your most recent will be considered.
    A team must have at most four (4) participants.

Use case ideas

Below are some sample use case ideas, for inspiration. You are not limited to these ideas.

    Summarize the latest news or YouTube videos on any topic
    Create a RAG application to help you understand the rules of any board game
    Create a customer support agent

Submission Instructions

Competition opens: Fri April 4 at 9:00 AM Pacific Time
Submission deadline: Sun April 20 at 11:59 PM Pacific Time
Making your submission
Complete the ➡️ Google Form here ⬅️ to submit your capstone project

    You must complete the form and hit "Submit" for your Capstone Project to be submitted
    You can make multiple submissions, but only the last submission will count, based on the timestamp of your submission
    If you, or any of your team members as listed in the Google Form, have made multiple submissions, all other previous submissions by any of the team members will be nullified, and only the last entry will be used in scoring based on the timestamp. This is done to ensure each participant has only one submission.
